## Stepping Out of My Comfort Zone

I’d been hearing great things about Biban since last year, but I didn’t get the chance to attend—so this year, I made sure not to miss it.

I’ll be honest: I don’t usually enjoy going to big events. But lately, I’ve been pushing myself to get out of my comfort zone. As a software engineer currently looking for new opportunities, I know that building meaningful relationships matters more than ever, especially in today’s economy. And I’m really glad I decided to go.

The first day was mostly about getting familiar with the venue and the atmosphere. I spent some time exploring the different sections and catching up with a few old friends. It was a good way to ease into the event and observe how everything was set up before diving in.

## Different Approach

Before heading out for the next two days, I made a plan. I went through the list of companies on Biban’s official website and picked the ones that caught my interest. My goal was to learn more about their work, business models, and even the technologies they rely on and why.

That focus made my conversations much more engaging and productive.

## Conversations That Stood Out

One of the best moments was meeting Ahmed Attar, host of بترولي and CEO of مختلف. He was incredibly down-to-earth and welcoming.

I also met the founders of OTO and Sabbar, both of whom were very approachable and open.

It was great reconnecting with the team at Nitx, who are building what might become the next Saudi unicorn. And I had an insightful chat with Albraa, the tech lead at Rekaz, about technology and the industry—genuinely inspiring conversation.

Of course, there were many other startups and companies I spoke with, but these stood out the most.
